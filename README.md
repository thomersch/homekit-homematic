# Homematic-Homekit Bridge

This is a bridge to enable controlling Homematic using Homekit (iOS/Watch OS/tvOS). It is written in Go and can be cross-compiled in order to run directly on the Homematic CCU, without any additional dependencies. It only needs around 7 MB of RAM, so it is much lighter than other solutions.

## Installation

You will need Go â‰¥ 1.9 before starting the procedure.

	go get -u github.com/thomersch/homematic-homekit
	cd $GOPATH/github.com/thomersch/homematic-homekit # if $GOPATH is not set, it defaults to ~/go
	GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=5 go build # this writes a binary into the same directory

After this, copy the binary onto the CCU (e.g. into `/etc/config/addons/`) and run it. For automatic start during boot, use the init script (homematic-homekit.sh), just copy it into `/etc/config/rc.d/`.

## Supported Devices

Currently the following device types are supported:

* Switches (can also be mapped to light or fan)
* Window Blinds/Cover

Additional mappings should be easy to implement. If you want to develop those, you can start by looking into `newBlind` and `newSwitch` in hmhk.go for Homekit support and into `Devices` in the hm package for Homematic support. PRs would be appreciated.
